# Most binary Linux distributions seem to fancy toolchains that do not
# do c++ support (need to install a separate package).  Since we don't
# check for g++, just make sure binutils won't try to build gold
# (needs c++), it will get there once we built our own GCC with c++
# support.  For that reason we cannot globally mask cxx, because then
# GCC will be built without c++ support too.
